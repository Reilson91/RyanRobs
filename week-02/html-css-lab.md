## Overview

Below is an overview of this lab and what you must do to complete it:
- Exercise 4-1
- Exercises 5-1 and 5-2

1. Pair Partner One (PP1) updates their local repo with any changes to the [Program Increment 1 HTML/CSS assignment repo](https://gitlab.mccinfo.net/code-school/course-work/pi1-html-css). (_Note: Pair Partner Two [PP2] may do the same, but it's not required for the assignmet._)
1. PP1 updates their local GitHub Pages repos with any remote changes.
1. PP1 copies the directory "[wk02-lab-exercise-files](wk02-lab-exercise-files/)" from this week's lab into their GitHub Pages project's `html-css/` folder.
1. PP1 creates a link to `html-css/wk02-lab-exercise-files/index.html` on  `html-css/index.html`
1. Follow the instructions for Exercise 4-1 in _Murach's HTML5 and CSS3_, page 164 - 166, with the following change:
    - For steps 1 and 2 on page 164, use `wk02-lab-exercise-files/index.html` and `wk02-lab-exercise-files/templates/basic.html`.
1. Follow steps 3 and following, making commits when changes are successfully made at each step.
1. After completing Exercise 4-1, follow the instructions for 5-1 and 5-2 on pages 198 - 199, with the following change:
    - For step 1, use the `index.html` and `main.css` you were working on in Exercise 4-1.

1. When switching, do the following:
    1. PP1 updates the remote repository with their local changes.
    1. Pair Partner Two (PP2) updates their local files with upstream changes.
    1. PP2 then starts on step 7 of the exercise in their environment.
    1. When complete, PP2 updates the remote repository with their local changes.
    1. PP2 makes a merge request (i.e. "pull request") in GitHub for PP1 to approve.
    1. PP1 approves the request and merges the changes.
    1. Both PP1 and PP2 should verify that their respective GitHub pages reflect the completed assignment.
