#### <a name="bellwork"></a>Bell Work
(_Note: Bell work should be done individually while waiting for class to start, although you should feel free to ask your pairing partner for help or advice if you get stuck._)
In your local environment, make the HTML/CSS equivalent of this:
![kitten-mockup](wk01-bell-work-kitten.jpg)
- Use [placekitten.com](http://placekitten.com) for the image.
- Use [catipsum.com](http://www.catipsum.com/) for the pargraph copy.
- Bonus points for getting the content block centered horizontally in the window while keeping the text left aligned.
