# Week 1 HTML/CSS Student Preparation Plan

_Note: Be sure to do all required preparation before class._

## Required

### Murach HTML5 and CSS3 Book
- Chatper 1: Introduction to Web Development
- Chapter 2: How to code, test and validate a web page
- Chapter 3: How to use HTML to structure a web page

_Note: I don't expect you **read** the Murach book like a novel. More importantly than reading every word is being able to explain the terms and provide a summary of the concepts from each chapter read._
